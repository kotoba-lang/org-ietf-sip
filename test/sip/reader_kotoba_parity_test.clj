;; `kotoba/sip/reader.kotoba` against `sip.message/decode`.
;;
;; The slice is the reader: start line, headers, and the point where headers
;; stop and a body of a declared length begins. The guest is an application
;; — state in, one line in, next state out — so the oracle and the guest are
;; handed the SAME message and compared on what each says it is.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; ## What is compared, and what deliberately is not
;;
;; The oracle decodes a whole message into structured values — URIs parsed
;; by `sip.uri`, Via by `sip.headers`, and so on. This guest reads the
;; transaction identity and hands the body to the host, so the comparison is
;; on that identity: kind, method, status, Call-ID, the topmost Via's branch,
;; CSeq, the From/To tags, and Content-Length. Where the oracle returns a
;; parsed structure the test projects the same field out of it; where the
;; guest has no nil, an absent value is "" or -1 on both sides.
;;
;; The body is NOT compared through the guest, because the guest never sees
;; it. It is compared through the host: the harness reads exactly
;; `body-bytes` octets, and `reader-carries-no-body-bytes` drives a body
;; three orders of magnitude past what a `:document` can hold.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Five, each for a rule that a careless reader loses while every
;; spelled-out, unfolded message still passes:
;;
;;   * `compact-header-forms-are-the-same-headers` — §7.3.3. `v` IS Via;
;;     a reader without the table sees a message with no mandatory headers;
;;   * `a-folded-header-continues-the-line-before-it` — §7.3.1, checked on
;;     Via, which is both the most often folded and the one that carries the
;;     transaction key;
;;   * `a-branch-without-the-magic-cookie-is-not-an-rfc3261-branch` —
;;     §8.1.1.7. Reporting the branch without reporting this hands a caller
;;     a transaction key it cannot trust;
;;   * `a-status-line-is-not-a-request-line` — §7.1/§7.2. The version
;;     prefix separates them, not the shape of the first token;
;;   * `reader-carries-no-body-bytes` — the passthrough design claim.
