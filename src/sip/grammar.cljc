(ns sip.grammar
  "Character-level SIP grammar primitives — RFC 3261 §25 (the full ABNF).
  Everything above this namespace (`sip.uri`, `sip.headers`, `sip.message`)
  is built out of these: tokens, quoted strings with backslash escapes,
  `;name=value` parameter tails, and top-level comma lists that don't get
  confused by commas hiding inside a quoted string or an angle-bracket
  URI.

  The classic wrong way to parse any of this is `(clojure.string/split s
  #\";\")` or `#\",\")` — which is exactly wrong the moment a quoted
  `Reason` string contains a comma (`Reason: SIP;cause=200;text=\"Call
  completed, thanks\"` is a real, legal header value) or a `tel:` URI's
  own parameters sit inside `<...>` next to a header-level `;tag=`. Every
  splitter here is a real scanner that tracks quote/bracket state, not a
  regex split."

  `NaN -> 0` rather than throwing. So `(int \\a)`, `(int \\=)`, every
